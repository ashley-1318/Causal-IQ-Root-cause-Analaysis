## 🔥 Problem Statement

In modern microservice environments, a single database glitch can trigger hundreds of downstream alerts. SRE teams suffer from **Alert Fatigue** — spending hours manually tracing dependencies to find "Patient Zero."

| Pain Point           | Impact                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Downtime Cost**    | $5,600 per minute on average (Gartner)               |
| **Manual Triage**    | 60–90 minutes per major incident                     |
| **Alert Noise**      | Thousands of symptomatic alerts masking 1 root cause |
| **Tribal Knowledge** | Diagnosis depends on a few experienced engineers     |

Traditional dashboards show _something_ is wrong — but not _why_ it's wrong or _how_ to fix it.

### End-to-End Workflow

**Phase 1 — Baseline Monitoring**
The SRE opens the CausalIQ Dashboard. ClickHouse ingests metrics continuously. The Causal Graph shows a healthy, pulsing network of services in green.

**Phase 2 — Incident Detection**
A service experiences a latency spike. The Ensemble Detector (Isolation Forest + Sliding Window Correlation) identifies this as an anomaly — ignoring natural busy-hour traffic patterns through online retraining.

**Phase 3 — Bayesian Assessment**
The Bayesian Engine calculates conditional probabilities using learned history. It asks: *"Given that Service A is failing, what is the probability that Service B is the root cause?"* It identifies the true origin of failure with mathematical precision.

#### 1. 🧠 Bayesian Causal Learning
Unlike simple rule-based tools, CausalIQ uses **Bayesian Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)** to calculate root-cause probabilities. It learns from every historical incident in ClickHouse, mathematically identifying which services are the true origin of failure versus mere symptoms.

#### 2. 🕸️ Graph-Based Topology
The system maps your infrastructure into a **Neo4j Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. When an anomaly occurs, the AI performs "Graph Traversal" to trace the path of destruction across upstream and downstream services.

#### 3. 🤖 Local Agentic AI (Ollama)
CausalIQ leverages **local LLMs (Llama 3 via Ollama)** to act as a "Senior SRE." The agent uses specialized tools to query metrics and logs, then synthesizes a human-readable explanation of the incident without any data ever leaving your network.

---

### 🚀 Closed-Loop Autonomous Remediation

CausalIQ doesn't just stop at detection. It features a fully autonomous "Remediation Executor":

- **High Confidence Mode (>95%):** The AI automatically executes the corrective action (e.g., scaling pods, restarting services) and notifies Slack/Jira.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Mode (<95%):** The AI presents a "Proposed Action" to the SRE in Slack with "Approve" and "Reject" buttons.
- **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** If an autonomous action fails to restore health, the system immediately escalates to a human operator.

### ⚡ Intelligent Throttling & Caching

To prevent "Alert Fatigue" and reduce operational costs:
- **MD5 Result Caching:** Identical failure patterns are cached in-memory. Repeat incidents receive instant diagnosis without re-running heavy AI cycles.
- **Service Cooldowns:** A 120-second cooldown window per service prevents alert storms during cascading failures.

**Phase 4 — Agentic Verification**
The Llama3.1 Agent wakes up and acts like an autonomous investigator:

1. **Tool Call →** Queries ClickHouse for `payment-service` DB connection logs
2. **Finding →** Discovers "Connection Pool Exhausted" error at timestamp
3. **Memory Check →** Queries Qdrant: _"Similar issue in Feb — resolved by increasing max_connections"_

**Phase 5 — Verified Resolution**
The Agent writes a verified report: _"Root Cause: Payment DB Pool Exhaustion at 14:23:01. Confidence: 94%. Recommendation: Scale DB connections to 300."_ Dashboard updates in real time.

**Result:** MTTR reduced from **60 minutes → 45 seconds**. Incident logged for future learning.

## 🧬 Intelligence Engine — The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Ensemble Anomaly Detection

| Property       | Detail                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algorithm**  | Isolation Forest (scikit-learn) + Sliding Window Correlation         |
| **Features**   | `avg_latency`, `p99_latency`, `error_rate`, `throughput` per service |
| **Retraining** | Online retraining every 5 minutes — adapts to natural traffic shifts |
| **Goal**       | Rapid, seasonality-aware detection with minimal false positives      |

### Pillar 2: Bayesian Causal Inference

| Property    | Detail                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Library** | `pgmpy` — Probabilistic Graphical Models                             |
| **Model**   | Structural Causal Model built from live Neo4j service topology       |
| **Logic**   | Computes _P(Service A = Root Cause \| Services B, C show anomalies)_ |
| **Priors**  | Uniform on fresh install → updated from resolved incident history    |
| **Goal**    | Eliminate false positives from downstream symptoms                   |

> **How priors improve over time:** On fresh install, the Bayesian engine uses uniform priors (equal probability across all nodes). After 10+ resolved incidents, priors are updated from ClickHouse incident history — the system becomes measurably more accurate week-over-week.

### Pillar 3: Agentic Verification (ReAct Pattern)

| Property      | Detail                                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Framework** | LangChain (ReAct Agent Pattern)                                                        |
| **LLM**       | Llama 3.1 via Ollama (self-hosted, data never leaves your infrastructure)              |
| **Tools**     | ClickHouse query, Neo4j graph traversal, Qdrant semantic search                        |
| **Embedding** | `nomic-embed-text` (dedicated embedding model — no compute competition with inference) |
| **Goal**      | Deep-dive verification + human-readable incident narration grounded in live evidence   |

## ✅ Prerequisites

| Requirement             | Minimum   | Recommended                |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Docker Desktop          | v24+      | Latest                     |
| RAM allocated to Docker | **16 GB** | 32 GB                      |
| CPU cores               | 4         | 8+                         |
| Disk space              | 20 GB     | 40 GB                      |
| Internet (first boot)   | Required  | Required                   |
| NVIDIA GPU              | Optional  | Recommended for faster LLM |

> **Why 16 GB?** Llama3.1 requires ~8 GB RAM alone. ClickHouse, Neo4j, Redpanda, and Qdrant each need 1–2 GB. Running below 16 GB will cause OOM crashes.

### Low-RAM Alternative

If your machine has less than 16 GB available for Docker, swap to a smaller model:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml → rca-engine service
environment:
  LLM_MODEL: llama3.2:1b # ~1.5 GB instead of ~8 GB
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1 — Pre-pull LLM Models (Do This First)

Ollama pulls Llama3.1 and nomic-embed-text on first boot — approximately 8 GB download. Do this before your demo, not during it.

```bash
# Start only Ollama first
docker-compose up -d ollama

# Wait 30 seconds, then pre-pull both models
docker exec causaliq-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3
docker exec causaliq-ollama-1 ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Confirm models are ready
docker exec causaliq-ollama-1 ollama list
```

### Step 2 — Clone and Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd causaliq

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d

# Monitor startup logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Step 3 — Wait for Readiness (~3–5 minutes)

Services start in dependency order. Check all services are healthy:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

All services should show `healthy` or `running`. If any service shows `unhealthy`, see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting).

### Step 4 — Open the Dashboard

| Interface              | URL                            | Credentials         |

| `EMBED_MODEL`             | `nomic-embed-text` | Embedding model for Qdrant incident vectorization.                              |
| `BAYESIAN_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.7`              | Minimum confidence to trigger Agentic verification phase.                       |
| `RAG_TOP_K`               | `3`                | Number of similar past incidents retrieved from Qdrant per query.               |

### Switch to Mistral

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml → rca-engine service
environment:
  LLM_MODEL: mistral
```

Also update the Ollama entrypoint to pull `mistral` instead of `llama3`.

### Use Slim Profile (Lower RAM)

To run only core services without Grafana, Jaeger, and Prometheus monitoring:

```bash
docker-compose --profile slim up -d
```

## 🛑 Troubleshooting

### Ollama is slow to respond or times out

LLM inference on CPU is slow. First inference after startup takes 30–60 seconds as the model loads into memory. Subsequent calls are faster. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, ensure Docker has GPU access enabled.

```bash
# Check if GPU is accessible
docker exec causaliq-ollama-1 nvidia-smi
```

### A service shows "unhealthy"

```bash
# Check logs for the specific service
docker-compose logs <service-name> --tail=50

# Restart a single service
docker-compose restart <service-name>
```

### Neo4j fails to start

Neo4j requires at least 2 GB RAM. Check Docker Desktop memory allocation and increase it if needed.

### Anomaly detector not triggering during simulation

The Isolation Forest needs `MIN_TRAINING_SAMPLES` (default: 100) data points before it can detect anomalies. Wait 2–3 minutes after startup for baseline metrics to accumulate, then trigger the simulation.

### ClickHouse connection refused

ClickHouse takes 60–90 seconds to fully initialize on first boot. If the backend reports connection errors, wait and retry.

```bash
# Verify ClickHouse is ready
curl http://localhost:8123/ping
# Expected response: Ok.
```

### Out of memory during startup

Reduce RAM usage by switching to a smaller LLM model:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  LLM_MODEL: llama3.2:1b
```

Then re-pull:

```bash
docker exec causaliq-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

---

## 🧹 Teardown

```bash
# Stop all services (preserves data volumes)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all volumes — full reset to clean state
docker-compose down -v

# Remove all built images as well
docker-compose down -v --rmi all
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Slack / PagerDuty webhook integration for incident notifications
- [ ] Remediation approval gate UI (human-in-the-loop before script execution)
- [ ] Kubernetes Helm chart for production deployment
- [ ] Incident export to PDF and Jira
- [ ] Model retraining dashboard with sample count and accuracy metrics
- [ ] Multi-tenant support with role-based access control
- [ ] Feedback loop: resolved incident outcomes update Bayesian priors automatically
